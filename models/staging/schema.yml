There are 14 licensed Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) in Britain and each is responsible for a regional distribution services area. DNO License Areas are sometimes referred to as GSP Groups. The DNO License Area boundaries are unusual because they are only well defined when tested. The boundaries tend to run through rural areas and change over time whenever a new connection is added close to a boundary. DNO License Areas are widely used as an aggregation entity when reporting electricity network data."

        change over time. In addition, the boundaries tend to flex over time when a new substation is added close to a boundary. Once we identify an existing 
        substation that is the closest neighbour to the new substation (the “distance” is measured by site-specific incremental MWkm), the boundary is, 
        theoretically, re-drawn to ensure that the new substation falls into the same generation zone that contains its nearest neighbouring substation. 
        The boundaries are indicative and come with the disclaimer that they are not 100% accurate. That said, they are a good indication of the geography

Postcodes are as at August 2024 in the UK and are best-fitted by plotting the location of the postcode's mean address into the areas of the output geographies.
        - pcd7 (Postcode 7-character): This is a 7-character version of the postcode, which includes the outward code (area and district) and the inward code (sector and unit). It is typically padded with spaces to ensure a length of 7 characters. For example, a postcode might be formatted as 'W1A 1AA'.
        - pcd8 (Postcode 8-character): This is an 8-character version of the postcode, ensuring that all postcodes are formatted to a consistent length of 8 characters. This often involves adding additional spaces where necessary. For example, 'W1A 1AA' would become 'W1A 1AA' (note the two spaces after the outward code)

Each LSOA is designed to have a similar population size to allow for comparable statistical reporting. Typically, an LSOA contains between 1,000 and 3,000 people, or about 400 to 1,200 households. LSOAs are part of a hierarchical system that also includes Middle Super Output Areas (MSOAs) and Upper Super Output Areas (USOAs).

        The report is based on the installations registered on the Central FIT Register (CFR). Data shown in the report is based on the number of installations that have completed accreditation during the quarter. There are five technologies eligible under the FIT scheme. These are:
        - Solar photovoltaic (PV): Up to 5MW Total Installed Capacity; assumed duration 25 years
        - Wind: Up to 5MW; assumed duration 20 years
        - Hydro: Up to 5MW; assumed duration 20 years
        - Anaerobic digestion: Up to 5MW; assumed duration 20 years
        - Micro-combined heat and power (CHP): Up to 2kW; assumed duration 10 years
        Exporters In order to receive export payments, the FIT generator must have the ability to export and have opted in to receive export payment from the FIT licensee. A FIT generator is not entitled to export payments if it does not have the ability to export electricity or has chosen to negotiate a price for the exported electricity on the open market. An accredited FIT installation with a total installed capacity of over 30kW must have an export meter to receive export payments from the FIT licensee.
        FIT payments must be made no less than quarterly, unless otherwise agreed in the Statement of FIT Terms. The levelisation process is the mechanism by which the cost of the FIT scheme is apportioned across Licensed Electricity Suppliers. The cost is apportioned based on each supplier’s share of the Great Britain electricity market, Periodic levelisation will take place quarterly. FIT year (1 April - 31 March). For the majority of installations the eligibility period is 20 years (10 years for micro CHP).
        If you are a generator who received full accreditation without first seeking FIT preliminary accreditation the “Eligibility Date” is the later of: the date a full accreditation application was received by us – i.e. the date that the application was submitted via the Register, and the start date of the tariff period that the installation falls into"

This means that projects below 1MW that were going through planning system before 2021 may not be represented in the REPD. The data is sourced mostly from the web and developers."

These figures are based on meter level electricity consumption data provided by data aggregators (who compile this data behalf of electricity suppliers). Electricity data is divided between 
        domestic and non-domestic categories according to the meter’s profile class. Domestic consumption is based on Non-Half Hourly (NHH) meters with profiles 1 and 2 (these are the standard domestic and economy 7 tariffs respectively). Non-domestic consumption is based on NHH meters with 
        profiles 3 to 8 and all Half-Hourly meters. In addition, profile 1 and 2 meters are re-allocated to the non-domestic sector if their annual consumption is greater than 100,000 kWh; or if their annual consumption is greater than 50,000 kWh and the address information for meter suggests
